# Pytris

A classic Tetris clone built with Python and Pygame. This project was created as part of my exploration into game development and 2D graphics using Python.

## Features

- Block rotation, movement, and collision detection
- Line-clearing logic and scoring system
- Game over detection
- Real-time keyboard controls
- Simple pixel-based graphics rendered with Pygame

## What I Learned

- Core concepts of game loops and frame-based updates
- Handling keyboard input and events in Pygame
- Implementing collision detection and game state logic
- Structuring a game with clean, maintainable Python code

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pygame

## Notes

This project was built by following a tutorial and adapting it to better understand game logic and event handling. The goal was to build a fully functioning clone and reinforce object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
